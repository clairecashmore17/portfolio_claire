                    <p>
                        <br>
                        I am a graduate with B.S. in Computer Engineering from Embry Riddle
                         Aeronautical University. I completed my studies with a 3.471 GPA while participating
                         in the schools collegiate soccer team. I hope to continue the pattern of maintaining a
                         balance between staying athletic and following my dreams in the software industry.
                          <br>
                          <br>

                        After completing my undergraduate degree, I decided to pursue Full-Stack development through George Washington University's 2U blended program. I 
                        have since gained experience in developing a full-stack application and hope to find a job to apply these 
                        skills. I am currently seeking a role as a full-stack developer or software engineer.

                         become experienced in any language.
